# Elm game base

Example base for a game in Elm 0.17.

The (only) file here is [Game.elm](Game.elm).

With elm-reactor in place really easy to get started:

```bash
â€º elm-reactor
```

Then you can point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/Game.elm](http://localhost:8000/Game.elm) and try it out (arrows left/right and spacebar to control).
